1.
    OTP is unreliable. Let’s not authenticate user with that. 
    Let’s authentic with Google account and let’s then show otp 
    verification page afterwards. 
    On the bottom of the page we can have a small skip button.

2.  
    But even with that, there needs to be an option to manually enter OTP

3. - Done
    Influencer name and pic should be present on video, from influencer profile 
    and liked videos. Though they should be inaccessible.  

Bugs:

1. Done
    No matter which video is clicked on the influencer’s profile, 
    it always starts from the 1st video. 

2. Done
    Liking/ unliking any video from influencer profile is causing the 
    influencer profile videos to break. They first get still and then they go blank.

3. The video is not adjusting to bigger screen size. 
There’s a black bar at the bottom
